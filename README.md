Login-Signup project using HTML CSS Handlebars NodeJS and MongoDB

Front-End:
I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript HandleBars Templating Engine to make front-end of the project i dont work too much on front-end i made this project with minimalist front-end part mainly focused on BackEnd part.

Back-End:
I used Nodejs as backend and MongoDB Database i also used BCRYPTJS for encryption to Hash the password. When user enteres wrong password it shows Invalid Login Details on Screen and Password must be same at the time of Registration.

I made Login-SignUp project using MySQL Database in #ecommerce-codemymobile repository other things are same because i made backend using nodejs.
